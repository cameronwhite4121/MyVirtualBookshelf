# MyVirtualBookshelf
The virtual bookshelf application's purpose is to help people with book collections better   
organize and keep track of all the books they own. The app is very thematic of a bookshelf,    
and organizes books onto different collections that I like they call shelves. There are more    
features in mind that I'm unsure will make it to the final cut including:   
- Giving a user the ability to favorite books
- Download the list of books in a shelf/across their collection in pdf format
- Wishlist books
- Filter sort books in a shelf
- Keeping track of books that have been read or not
- and more to come as development progresses

- Accessible via highlighted hamburger menu
